# GPS_tracking_System_Project_CSE211
The goal of this project is to develop an embedded system using C programming that  gathers real-time positional coordinates while a microcontroller is in motion after power-on until a destination point is reached.  The collected data will then be efficiently transferred to a personal computer (PC) and  visualized on a map application
